## sgalzin fork of Helm

### Release 0.9.1 "rebirth"
This fork of Helm has the following changes:

* Syntax: compiles with JUCE v8.0.0 (using CMake on linux, for other systems mileage may vary).
* Feat: enables providing a specific configuration file name "suffix" at startup.
* Feat: closes About dialog (overlay) when Escape key is pressed.
* Feat: enables getting and saving (key, value) pairs in the config file.
* Feat: saves the last patch used for it to be loaded by default at when synth restarts.
* Feat: enables saving the MIDI channel when assigning a controller via MIDI Learn.

#### Motivation

While trying to add a few things from my wishlist, I encountered difficulties compiling the plugin. My first step was therefore to minimally transform the code
in order to compile using the current version of JUCE. This was achieved using CMake on Linux. At this point, I am a beginner at all this and getting this to
compile in the first place was a bit of a challenge. Therefore I do not know if the Projucer or the other building systems configured in the original files still work. My directory is the following:
<pre>
├── concurrentqueue
├── docs
├── fonts
├── images
├── JuceLibraryCode                            [contains changes]
├── mopo
├── patches
├── src                                        [contains changes]
├── standalone

└── libs -> ~/dev/c++/libs/                    [new (linked) folder]
    ├── JUCE -> ~/dev/c++/libs/JUCE_v8.0.0
    ├── JUCE_v8.0.0
    └── cpm
</pre>
The only places in which I made changes are in the JuceLibraryCode folder, which has some updates from running the Projucer from JUCE v8, and in the src folder, to implement the upates for this "rebirth" version.

## Helm
Helm is a free, cross-platform, polyphonic synthesizer that runs on GNU/Linux, Mac, and Windows as a standalone program and as a LV2/VST/AU/AAX plugin. Release is in beta so there are outstanding bugs. Please send any bugs found to matthewtytel@gmail.com

### Installing:
Go to [tytel.org/helm](http://tytel.org/helm) for builds.

### Building:
If you want to build AAX plugins You'll need its SDK located in ~/srcs  
For AU on the Mac you'll want to put the CoreAudio SDK in /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Extras/CoreAudio  
Nothing extra is needed for building VST/LV2 plugins

#### Linux
To build and install the standalone, lv2 and vst plugin:
```bash
make
sudo make install
```

Other make commands:
```bash
# Build just the Linux standalone executable:
make standalone

# Build just the Linux LV2 plugin:
make lv2

# Build just the Linux VST plugin
make vst

# Install just the Linux standalone executable:
sudo make install_standalone

# Install just the Linux LV2 plugin:
sudo make install_lv2

# Install just the Linux VST plugin
sudo make install_vst
```

The standalone executable is built to standalone/builds/linux/build and installed to /usr/bin
The LV2 plugin is built to builds/linux/LV2 and installed to /usr/lib/lv2
The VST plugin is built to builds/linux/VST and installed to /usr/lib/lxvst

#### OSX
Open /standalone/builds/osx/Helm.xcodeproj for standalone version  
Open /builds/osx/Helm.xcodeproj for plugin versions

#### Windows
Open /standalone/builds/vs15/Helm.sln for standalone version  
Open /builds/vs15/Helm.sln for plugin versions

### Features:
 - 32 voice polyphony
